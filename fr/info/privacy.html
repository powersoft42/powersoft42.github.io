<span class="B C3">&bull; Types of data processed</span>

<span class="B C10">&bull; Navigation data</span>
During normal operation, the IT systems and software procedures used to run this site collect personal data, which is implicitly transmitted through the use of Internet communication protocols. This information is not collected in order to be associated with identified data subjects, but could, by its very nature, and if processed and integrated with third-party data, allow users to be identified. IP addresses, browser type, operating system, domain name and Web referring or exit pages, information on pages visited by a user within the site, access time, length of stay on each page, clickstream analysis and other parameters regarding the operating system and a user's IT environment all fall under this category of data. This technical/IT data is collected and used on an aggregated and anonymous basis exclusively to improve quality of service and obtain statistics on site use.

<span class="B C10">&bull; Cookies</span>
Cookies are pieces of information that may be saved in a computer during website navigation, in order to process and identify usage data. For more info on how this website uses cookies, please visit <a href="/fr/info/cookie.html">this page</a> to read about this website's detailed cookie policy.

<span class="B C10">&bull; Data voluntarily supplied by users</span>
These cases involve a user entering his/her personal data on the site in order to access personally selected services (like a newsletter, for instance.) In all cases, appropriate detailed information is provided and, where required, consent for the processing of personal data is obtained before a given service is activated. Said consent may be revoked at any time, whereby the ability to use the service in question is lost.

<span class="B C3">&bull; Data retention</span>
Data collected is retained only for the amount of time strictly necessary to achieve the purpose of the processing. Once the service has been provided, all personal data required to activate and manage the service requested will be deleted, in accordance with data retention policies, unless otherwise requested by government or legal authorities or otherwise stipulated by law.

<span class="B C3">&bull; Other forms of data usage</span>
In addition, and exclusively in the interest of law and order and prevention, investigation and/or prosecution of criminal offenses, the data provided may be used for purposes other than those required to provide services, and may be communicated to public entities, including law enforcement agencies and public and judicial authorities, to allow them to perform duties that fall under their responsibility.
