<h3>Facebook said hackers exploited a coding glitch that affected the service’s “View As” feature, which lets people see what their own profile looks like when someone else takes a look at it online. This allowed them to unlock access to people’s accounts.

It’s not clear yet what damage they did. What exactly did they do with their access?

However you can know that you were affected by Facebook’s massive data breach if Facebook’s forced you to log out and back into your account. Facebook says it has fixed the flaw and reset the access tokens of almost 50 million accounts.

If that happened, the chances are you were a victim of the breach. In any case, Facebook also reset the tokens of another 40 million customers as a precautionary measure.
